*Skinly* helps detect early-stage skin cancer. Using image classification, we work on recognizing various types of moles, predicting thus potential melanoma.

With *Skinly* users will be able to track and get insights about their moles, simply by naming them and taking regular photos. Having a timestamped list of photos for a single mole makes predictions even more accurate.
